This repo contains some projects that I am making to get better at Rust. This material is intended to be completed in 10-12 weeks alongside reading Designing Data Intensive Applications (Kleppmann), Algorithm Design (Kleinberg/Tardos), and taking an algorithms course (CSE 421). 


Prerequisites:
- Read the Rust book, complete the book exericse, complete Rustlings
- Data structures/CS foundations (CSE 332/CSE 312)


Projects - Snack-sized exercises. Complete in the order of: calculator, kv_store, kv_store_2, q, vector_search

Algos - Algorithms in CSE421 (UW CS). Every algorithm in the course will have an exercise to be implemnented in Rust.


If you have questions or concerns about anything in the repo, feel free to reach out to me at pw.hunt11@gmail.com. Everything here is a major work in progress.
